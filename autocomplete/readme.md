Autocomplete Component Guide

### Customization and Reusability

An autocomplete component should be customizable and reusable. The least flexible approach is using an object with key-value pairs, such as `{ textSize: "12px", textColor: "red" }`, for rendering. A more flexible approach is providing CSS classes to style the component. The most flexible method allows the developer to customize the rendering by invoking a function with relevant data, enabling them to define the UI dynamically.

### Query Handling and Performance Optimization

A minimum query length should be enforced to avoid irrelevant results; three characters is a reasonable threshold. A debounce time should be implemented to wait for user input to stop before making a request, reducing unnecessary API calls. Additionally, an API timeout should be set to handle cases where a response takes too long.

### Infinite Scrolling and Request Management

Infinite scrolling should be supported, and throttling should be applied to prevent multiple requests within a short time frame. Race conditions can occur when an older request's response arrives after a newer one, leading to incorrect results. Possible solutions include attaching timestamps to requests to ensure only the latest response is displayed or mapping results to corresponding input values. Using `AbortController` to cancel requests is not recommended, as the server may have already processed the request and returned data.

### Handling Unstable Internet Connections

Failures due to unstable network connections should be handled with automatic retries. A backoff strategy should be used to progressively increase wait times between retries, preventing server overload. If the network is lost, cached data can be used to avoid unnecessary requests and display an error message.

### Caching Strategies

Various caching strategies can be implemented. A simple hashmap can store results per query but may contain duplicate entries. A flat structure can be used for efficiency, though reading results may be difficult. A normalized structure, where results are keyed by an ID, allows efficient data retrieval.

If only a small number of results are displayed, pre-processing result IDs before displaying them has minimal performance impact. Short-lived websites can use simpler caching, while long-lived websites require more sophisticated caching strategies. Cached initial results, such as trending topics or user favorites, can be displayed when the input is empty. If the data changes rarely, cache entries can be long-lived, whereas frequently updated data (such as stock prices) should have minimal or no caching.

### Cache Usage and Memory Management

Different cache strategies, such as network-only, cache-only, or a combination of both, can be used. Cached results should also be utilized when a request fails. Long-lived websites consume significant memory, so periodic cache purging should be implemented. Instead of rendering all results at once, windowing should be used to render only visible items, improving performance.

### User Experience Enhancements

To improve usability, auto-focus should be applied when the input is selected. A loading indicator should be shown while fetching results, and errors should be clearly displayed. Long result text should be truncated with an ellipsis. Result items should be large enough for easy selection. The number of displayed results should adjust dynamically based on the viewport size.

### Accessibility and Usability Considerations

Search functionality should not interfere with other attributes. Keyboard interactions should be supported, including pressing the Escape key to close results and using arrow keys to navigate options. To enhance search accuracy, results should be ranked based on their distance from the query using edit distance (Levenshtein distance). If there is insufficient space below the input field, results should be displayed above it. Accessibility should be prioritized, particularly when semantic elements are not used, ensuring usability for all users.
